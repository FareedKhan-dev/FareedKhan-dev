- Hi, I’m @FareedKhan-dev
- As a Data Scientist, I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics and computer science, with experience in using various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras to build and optimize models. I have experience in text analytics and natural language processing, using libraries such as NLTK and spaCy to extract insights from unstructured data. I am well-versed in big data technologies such as Hadoop and Spark, and able to handle large datasets. My knowledge in reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning, SARSA, etc enables me to apply them to real-world problems and make data-driven decisions. I am a proactive problem solver, always looking for new and innovative ways to extract insights from data. I am driven by a passion for data science and eager to apply my skills to help organizations make better decisions and drive growth.
